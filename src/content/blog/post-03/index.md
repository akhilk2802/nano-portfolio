## The Application Process

I applied for the Software Engineering Co-op position at Tesla through their careers portal. Like many others, I had received several rejection emails from Tesla in the past, so I wasn’t expecting much this time either.

Then, out of the blue, I received an email from a recruiter. It was completely unexpected, but I immediately noticed that the job description aligned well with my previous experience, particularly my work with .NET. I suspected that this was a key factor in getting shortlisted.

## Initial Communication and Scheduling

The recruiter’s email contained a few standard questions regarding my availability for interviews, work authorization, and background. All of this was handled over email. I promptly responded, and we scheduled the interview for the following week.

## Interview Structure

The interview process consisted of two back-to-back rounds, each lasting 45 minutes:

### Round 1: Technical Discussion and Coding Challenge

 - The first round was conducted by a **Staff Engineer**.

 - It started with introductions and a discussion about my previous work experience.

 - The interviewer asked conceptual questions about **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), design patterns,** and then dived deeper into my past projects and responsibilities.

 - This initial discussion lasted about **20 minutes.**

 - Then came the coding challenge—a **LeetCode medium-level Dynamic Programming (DP) problem.**

 - Since this was my first coding interview in a long time, I was a bit nervous. I managed to come up with the right algorithm but got stuck on an optimization bug, which caused me to exceed the given time.

 - The interviewer appreciated my intuition and approach but might have expected a fully optimized solution.


### Round 2: Technical Discussion, Coding, and System Design

 - The transition to the second round was immediate. A **Senior Engineer** joined the same call while the first interviewer exited.

 - This round followed a similar structure: introductions, a brief discussion about the role, and a deep dive into my technical skills and past experience.

 - The interviewer then presented me with a **LeetCode medium-level string manipulation problem.**

 - This problem was relatively easy, and I started with a brute-force approach before optimizing it efficiently.

 - After that, I was asked **two high-level system design questions** based on technologies mentioned in my resume. I was able to answer them confidently.


## The Outcome

I was optimistic after the interview, despite not having fully optimized my first-round coding solution. Two days later, however, I received a **rejection email.** Naturally, I felt disappointed, but I also saw this experience as a **valuable learning opportunity.**

## Key Takeaways and Lessons Learned

1. **Preparation matters** – Even though I had the intuition for the DP problem, my lack of recent practice led to struggles in optimizing my solution under pressure.

2. **Interviews test more than just coding** – My past experience, system design skills, and problem-solving approach were well received.

3. **Expect the unexpected** – Despite feeling confident about my overall performance, the outcome was different than I had hoped. That’s just how the process works sometimes.

4. **Keep improving** – This experience helped me identify areas for improvement, and I’m now focusing on refining my problem-solving speed and practicing **DP and optimization techniques** more rigorously.


While it was disappointing not to receive an offer, I am grateful for the opportunity and will use this experience to come back stronger in my future interviews!
