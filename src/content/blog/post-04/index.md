## The Application Process

I applied for the Software Engineering Spring Co-op role at Oracle through their careers portal around the **fourth week of September.** After weeks of silence, I finally received an email from a recruiter in **the second week of October** to schedule a quick 30-minute call.

## Initial Call with Recruiter

**I immediately scheduled the call** for the same week. This was a brief conversation where we discussed:

 - The **role and my availability** for the interview process.

 - My **background and interests.**

 - How my skills **aligned with the position.**

At the end of the call, the recruiter asked me to share my availability, and she scheduled my technical interview for the **following week.**


## Interview Preparation

I received an email with:

 - Meeting links for both rounds.
 - Details on what to expect in the interview.
 - A PDF guide on how to prepare.
 
I had **one week to prepare**, so I focused on:

 - Revising Data Structures and Algorithms.
 - Reviewing Object-Oriented Programming concepts.
 - Leveraging my Cloud Computing knowledge (since I was taking a Cloud Computing course at the time). This turned out to be a huge advantage during discussions.


## The Interview Day

The interview consisted of **two back-to-back rounds**, each **one hour long.**

### Round 1: Technical Discussion and Coding Challenge

 - Conducted by a **Staff Engineer.**

 - Started with **an introduction and discussion about the product** I would be working on.

 - A **deep dive into my resume,** where the interviewer seemed particularly interested in one of my projects.

 - He asked me to explain my project in **great detail**, and I was able to answer all his questions. This lasted for about **30 minutes.**

 - **Next 30 minutes: Coding Challenge**

   - I was asked to **share my screen and open a Python interpreter** (choice of language was flexible).
   - **First question**: LeetCode **medium-level string manipulation problem**. I    solved and optimized it in 15 minutes.
   - **Second question**: LeetCode **medium-level linked list problem**. I solved it in **10 minutes.**
   - **Follow-up question**: The interviewer tested my **intuition and approach** without requiring implementation.
   - The interviewer seemed **very impressed**, and we ended the round on a high note.

### Round 2: Technical Discussion, System Design, and Problem-Solving

 - Conducted by a **Principal Engineer**.

 - Followed a similar pattern:
   - **Introduction**.
   - Deep dive into my **resume**. 
   - **High-level design questions** based on my resume (this lasted about 25 minutes).
    
 - Problem-solving questions:
   
   - **First question: A real-life problem** similar to Buy and Sell Stock II (LeetCode Medium).
     - I **took my time to understand the question**.
     - Implemented the complete solution.
     - Answered detailed follow-up questions on time and space complexity
     
   - **Second question**: **A system design scenario based on databases and querying.**
     - It was a tricky but fun problem.
     - My knowledge of **REST APIs and SQL basics** helped me solve it.
     - The interviewer **agreed with my approach**, and we ended on another high note.


## The Waiting Game & The Unexpected Outcome

After such a strong performance, I was **very confident** about receiving an offer. The recruiter had assured me that I would get my results **within two days** (the interview was on **Friday**, and the results were expected by **Monday**).

However, Monday came and went—**no email.**

- I waited for **three more days**, still **nothing.**
- I followed up with the recruiter, and she said the **hiring manager hadn’t decided yet**.
- More **days passed, followed by weeks, with continuous follow-ups.**
- This dragged on for **almost a month**.

At this point, **I knew I was probably rejected**, but I still had a **tiny bit of hope** because I had **performed so well**. I kept following up, wondering **what went wrong**.

Finally, on **December 12, 2024**, I received the dreaded email: **rejected**.

## The Reason for Rejection

The reason they provided? **They didn’t have a project that matched my skills.**

Honestly, this was **extremely disappointing**. I had aced the interview, and yet the decision wasn’t based on my performance. It felt unfair, but sometimes in job hunting, **even when you do everything right, luck doesn’t always work in your favor.**

## Final Thoughts & Takeaways

- **Give every interview your best shot** – you never know which opportunity will work out.
- **Follow up with recruiters** – but be prepared for delays and uncertainties
- **Even strong performances can result in rejection** – hiring decisions aren’t always about skills alone.
- **Keep improving and moving forward** – rejection is just another step toward the right opportunity.

While this experience was frustrating, it was also **a learning experience**. On to the next one!
